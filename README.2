Notes:

* needed to make some config changes as my system was running ruby 2.3.0 and rails 5.0.0.1 
  and, as a result, I was having numerous issues with gem versions; also, decided to use MySQL 
  instead of SQLite, as this allowed me to use foreign keys and make associations a little easier.

* to properly finish some testing (javascript,ajax), I would've needed to install the capybara-webkit gem,
  but I was having difficulties installing it - appears to be some problem with my version of either 
  QT, webkit, and/or Xcode.

* normally, I would've normalized the 'rules' table
